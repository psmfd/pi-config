# Subagent Example

> **Vendored from pi 0.78.1** (source: `examples/extensions/subagent/` in the pi 0.78.1 release tarball); re-audited against pi 0.78.1 on 2026-06-07 (pi_config #296) — upstream `index.ts`/`agents.ts` are byte-unchanged between 0.78.0 and 0.78.1; `index.ts` is byte-identical to ours apart from patch #3, and 0.78.1 still ships the dead `tool_result_end` branch (not adopted upstream), so patch #3 is retained. `agents.ts` is identical. Patches #1 (full per-task output) and #2 (failed-task diagnostics) were dropped at the 0.75.4 re-audit (pi_config #136) when upstream adopted them per [earendil-works/pi#4710](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/4710). Only patch #3 (`tool_execution_*` UI refresh) remains.

## Local patches

This vendored copy carries downstream patches that diverge from upstream `earendil-works/pi-mono` HEAD. When bumping the snapshot, re-apply or drop these patches based on whether they have been merged upstream.

| Patch | File | Lines (post-patch) | Rationale | Upstream issue |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `tool_execution_*` UI refresh | `index.ts` | ~367–377 | Upstream's `tool_result_end` branch is dead in current pi: agent-session.js emits `tool_execution_start` / `tool_execution_end` (re-verified against pi 0.78.1 `docs/extensions.md` § 565 and `docs/rpc.md` § 852; `tool_result_end` is no longer documented), neither of which carries an `event.message`. We replace the dead branch with an `emitUpdate()` call on both edges so the orchestrator sees per-tool-call streaming progress during long child runs, without injecting synthetic messages into `currentResult.messages` (which would corrupt `getFinalOutput`). Tracked in pi_config issue #46. (pi also emits a `tool_execution_update` event for intermediate progress, not yet consumed — see #46.) | _pending (separate upstream report; see pi_config issue #46 for context)_ |

Delegate tasks to specialized subagents with isolated context windows.

## Features

- **Isolated context**: Each subagent runs in a separate `pi` process
- **Streaming output**: See tool calls and progress as they happen
- **Parallel streaming**: All parallel tasks stream updates simultaneously
- **Markdown rendering**: Final output rendered with proper formatting (expanded view)
- **Usage tracking**: Shows turns, tokens, cost, and context usage per agent
- **Abort support**: Ctrl+C propagates to kill subagent processes

## Installation

From the repository root, symlink the files:

```bash
# Symlink the extension (must be in a subdirectory with index.ts)
mkdir -p ~/.pi/agent/extensions/subagent
ln -sf "$(pwd)/packages/coding-agent/examples/extensions/subagent/index.ts" ~/.pi/agent/extensions/subagent/index.ts
ln -sf "$(pwd)/packages/coding-agent/examples/extensions/subagent/agents.ts" ~/.pi/agent/extensions/subagent/agents.ts

# Symlink agents
mkdir -p ~/.pi/agent/agents
for f in packages/coding-agent/examples/extensions/subagent/agents/*.md; do
  ln -sf "$(pwd)/$f" ~/.pi/agent/agents/$(basename "$f")
done

# Symlink workflow prompts
mkdir -p ~/.pi/agent/prompts
for f in packages/coding-agent/examples/extensions/subagent/prompts/*.md; do
  ln -sf "$(pwd)/$f" ~/.pi/agent/prompts/$(basename "$f")
done
```

## Security Model

This tool executes a separate `pi` subprocess with a delegated system prompt and tool/model configuration.

**Project-local agents** (`.pi/agents/*.md`) are repo-controlled prompts that can instruct the model to read files, run bash commands, etc.

**Default behavior:** Only loads **user-level agents** from `~/.pi/agent/agents`.

To enable project-local agents, pass `agentScope: "both"` (or `"project"`). Only do this for repositories you trust.

When running interactively, the tool prompts for confirmation before running project-local agents. Set `confirmProjectAgents: false` to disable.

## Usage

### Single agent

```text
Use scout to find all authentication code
```

### Parallel execution

```text
Run 2 scouts in parallel: one to find models, one to find providers
```

### Chained workflow

```text
Use a chain: first have scout find the read tool, then have planner suggest improvements
```

### Workflow prompts

```text
/implement add Redis caching to the session store
/scout-and-plan refactor auth to support OAuth
/implement-and-review add input validation to API endpoints
```

## Tool Modes

| Mode | Parameter | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Single | `{ agent, task }` | One agent, one task |
| Parallel | `{ tasks: [...] }` | Multiple agents run concurrently (max 8, 4 concurrent) |
| Chain | `{ chain: [...] }` | Sequential with `{previous}` placeholder |

## Output Display

**Collapsed view** (default):

- Status icon (✓/✗/⏳) and agent name
- Last 5-10 items (tool calls and text)
- Usage stats: `3 turns ↑input ↓output RcacheRead WcacheWrite $cost ctx:contextTokens model`

**Expanded view** (Ctrl+O):

- Full task text
- All tool calls with formatted arguments
- Final output rendered as Markdown
- Per-task usage (for chain/parallel)

**Parallel mode streaming**:

- Shows all tasks with live status (⏳ running, ✓ done, ✗ failed)
- Updates as each task makes progress
- Shows "2/3 done, 1 running" status

**Tool call formatting** (mimics built-in tools):

- `$ command` for bash
- `read ~/path:1-10` for read
- `grep /pattern/ in ~/path` for grep
- etc.

## Agent Definitions

Agents are markdown files with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: my-agent
description: What this agent does
tools: read, grep, find, ls
model: claude-haiku-4-5
---

System prompt for the agent goes here.
```

**Locations:**

- `~/.pi/agent/agents/*.md` - User-level (always loaded)
- `.pi/agents/*.md` - Project-level (only with `agentScope: "project"` or `"both"`)

Project agents override user agents with the same name when `agentScope: "both"`.

## Sample Agents

| Agent | Purpose | Model | Tools |
|-------|---------|-------|-------|
| `scout` | Fast codebase recon | Haiku | read, grep, find, ls, bash |
| `planner` | Implementation plans | Sonnet | read, grep, find, ls |
| `reviewer` | Code review | Sonnet | read, grep, find, ls, bash |
| `worker` | General-purpose | Sonnet | (all default) |

## Workflow Prompts

| Prompt | Flow |
|--------|------|
| `/implement <query>` | scout → planner → worker |
| `/scout-and-plan <query>` | scout → planner |
| `/implement-and-review <query>` | worker → reviewer → worker |

## Error Handling

- **Exit code != 0**: Tool returns error with stderr/output
- **stopReason "error"**: LLM error propagated with error message
- **stopReason "aborted"**: User abort (Ctrl+C) kills subprocess, throws error
- **Chain mode**: Stops at first failing step, reports which step failed

## Limitations

- Output truncated to last 10 items in collapsed view (expand to see all)
- Agents discovered fresh on each invocation (allows editing mid-session)
- Parallel mode limited to 8 tasks, 4 concurrent
